Today's strip is a continuation of the one from yesterday, and raises an interesting question: How many stockings would you put up if you were a centipede? Further, how many stockings would you need if you were, say, a centipede family of four? Would you have enough space in your home to hang all of them? Do centipedes have chimneys? Does centipede Santa have a beard or just more antennae? So many questions.
