Doonesbury is another comic strip that I wouldn't say is a favorite, but that I've always had respect for. I never really read it, because I find the dialogue to be overly wordy and often uninteresting. Still, it's an important comic strip that's worth paying attention to and going back and reading.

This particular strip, however, is pretty frivolous, but it brought up some interesting thoughts for me. I really don't remember when I found out Santa wasn't real. I don't have a particular story of anyone telling me, my parents never had a "talk" with me about it (that I recall), I guess I just kind of organically grew out of it. Unless, of course, the experience was so traumatic that I've blocked it from my mind, but I doubt it.
