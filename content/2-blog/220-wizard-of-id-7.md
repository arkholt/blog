Fun fact: Mick and Mason Mastroianni, grandsons of Wizard of Id creator Johnny Hart and current Wizard of Id creative team, were born after the first Garfield comic strip was published. That seems very weird to me, but probably only to me.

Anyway, what do you get the man who not only has everything but owns everything in the country? A new torture device, it looks like. I wonder if he'll actually deign to enter the dungeon to use it himself or if he'll have one of his minions do it.
