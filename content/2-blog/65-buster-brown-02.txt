Here's another one with Buster Brown. This one is more along the lines of what Buster normally gets into. Of course, this time he has the help of all the neighborhood boys. I kind of think the parents were asking for it, though, given that they put swords and guns underneath the Christmas tree. Those were different times, I guess.
