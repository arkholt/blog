*Roughin’ Reddy* was a “topper” strip created by C. D. Small, which, as toppers were, was printed above the main strip he drew at the time, *Salesman Sam*. Small took over for the strip’s original creator, George Swanson, when Swanson was hired by another syndicate. Small not only took over, but emulated Swanson’s art style so completely that their work is nearly indistinguishable. It’s amazing, then, that Small was able to create a companion topper that matched the same style.

I would have included the *Salesman Sam* strip that accompanies this, but it doesn’t have anything to do with Christmas, so I left it out.
