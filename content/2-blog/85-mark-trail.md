Mark Trail is a comic strip that has always been about nature, ever since Ed Dodd created it in 1946. The Christmas strips have never tended to deviate from that too much, and generally include things about nature that are relevant to the season. This strip from a couple years ago, by current artist James Allen, continues that tradition. It also includes a hint of religious themes, as Dodd was also wont to do, most probably because his father was a Baptist minister.

Mark Trail as a comic has never really interested me that much, but Ed Dodd is from my home state of Georgia, and The Lost Forest where Mark Trail lives is apparently located in north Georgia as well, so I feel a bit of a connection.
