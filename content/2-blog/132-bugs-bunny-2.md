Ah, the indoor ski jump. Definitely seems like the type of ridiculous thing that would appear in a Bugs Bunny cartoon, but could never actually exist in real life. At the very least, they wouldn't put it right next to the Santa Claus display and endanger the large amounts of children lining up to see him.

Again, this is very different from what one would expect to see Bugs do in a cartoon. A cartoon would be more likely to give Bugs a clever quip to say to Santa at the end instead of turning to the audience and saying something cliche. Also, I really wish Roger Armstrong was given more space for the artwork. With the size of the panels he was able to use, it all feels very cramped and spare. I imagine he could have shown us something much more interesting with larger panels. Due to financial concerns, however, the 40s were the time when newspapers really began shrinking the comics considerably, so this kind of thing was happening more and more.
