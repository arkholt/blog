The holidays are supposed to be a time of joy, but often they are a time of disappointment. Sometimes, like in this strip, it's not about the gifts but about the friends and connections that we have, or don't have. Thankfully, Charlie Brown shows us that, despite his disappointments, he can move on and make something good out of his holiday season. I wish I was as resilient as he is.
