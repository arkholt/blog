This isn't a New Year celebration tradition that I've heard of before, but Richard Thompson says he did it when he was a kid. The child inside me thinks that this might be fun to try, because who wouldn't want to try ridiculous things you read in comic strips? The adult inside me, however, thinks it would be far too loud and obnoxious, and that I would certainly be annoyed if someone else was doing it. So I probably won't. Then again, we will have my nieces over for New Year's. Maybe I can get them to do it.

Don't forget to admire the lines on that couch. I mean, look at those lines, people.
