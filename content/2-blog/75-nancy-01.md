The past two years, I've posted Christmas themed comic strips during December, so I thought I'd make it a tradition and do it again this year. We start with a not necessarily Christmassy but definitely wintery themed Nancy strip. I love Ernie Bushmiller's [Nancy](http://www.toonopedia.com/nancy.htm), mostly because of its simplicity. After Bushmiller died in 1982, a few other creators have done admirable runs on Nancy, but none of them have the spirit of the original. Mark Lasky did the best at capturing the look of the artwork, but that was about it. I quite like Jerry Scott's version, but it might have been better served by being a separate comic strip entirely, because it certainly feels like it is. Guy Gilchrist, who does the strip currently, does fine, but it feels very generic. Bushmiller's is still the best. You might not think so from this fairly simple example, but you will as the month goes on.

This year, I also discovered the Scott McCloud invention [Five Card Nancy](http://www.scottmccloud.com/4-inventions/nancy/index.html), which I feel like I should have known about much earlier. It might be a nice game to play with your family on Christmas Eve or something. Also, if you don't want to go through the trouble of preparing physical cards, there's also a handy [online version](http://www.7415comics.com/nancy/).
