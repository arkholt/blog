Here are the third and fourth days of the Hal Foster short-run series *The Christmas Story*. You'll notice that Foster takes a few liberties with the story when writing the captions, but I guess I'd expect that from a man who regularly wrote a comic strip that was an embellishment of Arthurian legend. Still, showing Mary being happy and singing while traveling miles through sleet and snow is a bit of a stretch. I don't really mind it that much, though, because I mostly just pay attention to the amazing artwork. It's definitely hang on the wall material.
