George Swanson originally created the comic strip *Salesman Sam* for the Newspaper Enterprise Association (or NEA) in 1921. The strip was about a high strung owner of a general store, and it was very popular at the time. Swanson was so popular, in fact, that in 1927 King Features Syndicate hired him to create a comic strip for them, which he called *High Pressure Pete*. It had a similar concept, and similar art, and the two strips are a bit difficult to distinguish between. It probably would have also been called *Salesman Sam* if it weren't for copyright issues.

One of the more popular characters that Swanson created for the strip was Officer 6 7/8, who, as shown here, eventually found his way into the title. As we see, he's a good hearted fellow, though not too bright. I guess we know where all of his Christmas money is going.
