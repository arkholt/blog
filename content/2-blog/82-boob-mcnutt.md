While Rube Goldberg was best known for his wacky contraptions, he was quite the prolific cartoonist, and had quite a few other comic strips over the years. One of the longest running was Boob McNutt, which revolved around a man with a good heart but with a less than stellar brain. It ran for nearly 15 years, and became a bit of a connection point between Goldberg's various strips. The titular characters in Goldberg's strip "Mike and Ike (They Look Alike)" were revealed to be Boob's uncles, Boob became acquainted with Lucifer Gorgonzola Butts, who was the "inventor" of all of Rube Goldberg's many devices, and Boob even ran into Bertha the Siberian Cheesehound, which was the topper for the Boob McNutt strip.

The strip itself normally involved someone entrusting Boob with performing a particular task and his inability to do the task without causing destruction and disaster. He's always willing to help, and looks trustworthy enough, but in the end it never works out. Such is the case here. Personally, I blame the goat for this one. What was he even doing out in the back yard in the first place?
