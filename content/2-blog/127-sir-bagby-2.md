This strip brings up a few questions. First, why would you wrap up the tree the partridge was living in, either trapping him inside and suffocating him or effectively kicking him out of his house? Second, will Bagby be getting all the gifts on the list from the 12 Days of Christmas song? If so, wouldn't it be weird on day 8 when he gives 8 maids a-milking to a milkmaid? Or is the idea to give her some other maids to do her work for her?

Though I guess the key to comedy is to not overthink it.
