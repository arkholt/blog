Bringing Up Father is all about a man who gets rich unexpectedly, and moves into a much larger house than he's used to. I'd imagine that along with that would come more closet space and therefore more options for hiding Christmas presents, but I guess Jiggs and Maggie still went for the same one when deciding where to hide them. Good thing Maggie wrapped hers first.
