Another from *The Gumps*, which does not actually include any of the Gumps, but it does mention Andy Gump's generosity from [the last strip I shared](http://blog.arkholt.com/the-gumps-1). I find it a bit odd that Santa seems to imply that he only visits white children, but it's difficult to find comic strips from the early 20th century that don't have some kind of racial bias. I hope Santa takes his own advice and is more unselfish, generous, and kind-hearted to *everyone* this year.
