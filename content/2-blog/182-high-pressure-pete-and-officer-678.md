I posted a *High Pressure Pete* strip [a few years ago](http://blog.arkholt.com/high-pressure-pete), but I can't get enough of George Swanson.

One of the more popular characters that Swanson created for the strip was Officer 6 7/8, who, as shown here, eventually found his way into the title. As we see, he's a good hearted fellow, though not too bright. I guess we know where all of his Christmas money is going.
