At the end this year, do as Barney and Horseface have done, and mend some fences. I don't recommend doing it over the alcohol that they've clearly been consuming, because, as you can see, it leads to more problems than it solves. Just try to leave this year on the best note you can, so that the next year can begin on a good one, too.

Happy 2019, everybody!
