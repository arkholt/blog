Chester Gould's Dick Tracy Christmas comic strips are very weird. Instead of doing what a lot of action and adventure cartoonists did and show a drawing of the whole cast together saying "Merry Christmas," he would have to tie in the detective theme somehow, with varying results. I think this one works pretty well. It's kind of awkward, but I appreciate the effort.
