I've of course [written about Rube Goldberg before](http://blog.arkholt.com/comic-strip-history-rube-goldberg-machines/), and all of his comic strip inventions are incredibly fun to look at and read. Fortunately, he also did a few dealing with Christmas. This one should be quite useful for this time of year, if you still haven't decided on what to get your significant other yet. Also, I'm sure the target for the blindfolded archer can be switched out depending on who you are deciding for. I would hope not everyone on your list would want perfume, hankies, jewelry, and furs. After all, I'm sure the blindfolded archer is going to expect a present, too, and I don't imagine he's into those things.

The other beautiful thing about this device is that if your savings (A) are not heavy enough to lift the hat (C), then the decision has already been made.
