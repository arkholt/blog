Skippy, created by Percy Crosby, was a comic strip that was popular enough in its day to spawn a radio show, a novel, an Oscar-nominated movie, and even a highly contentious copyright feud with a peanut butter brand. It probably deserves its own much longer blog post (which I will probably do eventually), but for now we'll just focus on Christmas.

I absolutely love Crosby's artwork. I've seen a few Skippy Sundays, and normally Sunday comics are superior to the dailies due to the larger format and ability to add color, but Crosby's simple linework on its own actually makes me enjoy the dailies more. It's said that this strip was a major influence on Charles Schulz when he created Peanuts, and I can see why.
