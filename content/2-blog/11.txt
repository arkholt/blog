...[is the fact that the reach of the Facebook Page for one's business or interest is shrinking so that Facebook can make more money.](http://time.com/34025/the-free-marketing-gravy-train-is-over-on-facebook/)

>Over the past several months, Facebook has been reducing the organic reach of Pages. A recent study found that companies' posts dropped from reaching 12% of their followers in October to just 6% by February.

At some point, Facebook will just stop the charade and make having a Facebook page a paid perk. I'm not sure what the algorithm is that determines who gets to see your page's updates, though I wouldn't be surprised if it's entirely random. I'm not sure what the point of having a Facebook page is anymore. I've never had a whole lot of success with mine, but it wasn't bad. Now, not knowing who will see it, I might as well just forget it. I don't have money for advertising, and this shady move by Facebook isn't convincing me that I should pay for it.

Besides that, what if I'm a consumer who wants to get updates from a particular business or interest? I don't get to see them. There are pages that I forgot that I liked and actually thought, \"Hey, why haven't I liked this on Facebook?\" only to find out that I did already. I only forgot because I hadn't seen an update from them in months, and it's not because they haven't posted any updates.

If my friends would just move to another social network, I wouldn't use Facebook. Each day, though, I consider just leaving it regardless of what my friends do.
