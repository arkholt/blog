Reg'lar Fellers, created by Gene Byrnes, first appeared under that name in 1920 and revolved around the gang of kids you see here. They were supposed to be suburbanites, but oddly enough speak exactly like kids from Byrnes' native New York City. The strip lasted until 1949, meaning this particular strip was one of the later ones that, while still signed by Byrnes, were not written or drawn by him. This one was ghosted by George Carlson. It was very popular in it's time, and spawned books, comic books, animated and live-action films, and a radio show. The strip is very charming and enjoyable, and definitely has a well-deserved place among the best of the comic strips about kids.

This one does bring up a good question, though: What *does* Santa Claus do the rest of the year? I don't imagine he's just sleeping the whole time, but if your job really only takes one night of the year, and you're a magical being, it must be difficult to fill the rest of the time.
