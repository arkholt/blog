Here we have Sir Rodney the Chickenhearted, receiving a gift from the king befitting of his name as well as his nature. Despite his cowardice, Sir Rodney is the head of the royal army *and* navy. I'd imagine this means that Id is a very safe kingdom, given their lack of need of any kind of competent military to protect them. The king doesn't seem to mind that Sir Rodney is this way, and in fact seems to be encouraging it. Maybe he's just hoping that Sir Rodney will be killed in battle so he can appoint someone else to the head of his military.
