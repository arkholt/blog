This strip probably won't make much sense to anyone who doesn't know what a milkman is or how milk delivery used to work. For those who don't get it, take this as a learning opportunity and look it up. I know, you shouldn't have to do research just to get a joke, but think of it this way: if you do the research now, you'll get all the other milkman jokes I'll post on this blog in the future.
