I've written about Dick Tracy before, in my post on [costumed heroes in comic strips](http://blog.arkholt.com/comic-strip-history-costumed-heroes/). Here's a notable example of the original run of Dick Tracy by the strip's creator, Chester Gould. He obviously didn't want to do anything to derail the story just because it was Christmas. The story seems to end here, with all of the dialogue appearing to tie up all of the loose ends. It's something about an evil plot with poison gas that apparently blinded Tracy somehow. But there's a Christmas tree and wreaths and presents, so that makes it a Christmas strip, right?
