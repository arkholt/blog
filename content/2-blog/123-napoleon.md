Napoleon, like other comic strip dogs over the years, can be a bit bumbling and stupid, but as we see here, he still has a heart of gold. I think I'd rather get gifts brought to me by a dog dressed as Santa Claus than a grumpy old man anyway.

I love Clifford McBride's loose but realistic style. I enjoy the artwork so much, the dialogue is almost not needed in this strip at all. In fact, if I was the editor, I might just tell him to remove it entirely. The images tell the story completely.
