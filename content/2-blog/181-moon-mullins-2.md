Here we see the Lady Plushbottom mentioned in the other Moon Mullins strip I posted a few days ago. The "Moonshine" mentioned is the full name of the title character, Mr. Mullins. I think Moon is actually doing some smart thinking here; Lord Plushbottom is the one who should be getting her the beads that last a lifetime. Moon is just getting a token obligatory gift for his landlord. No need to spend too much on that, right?

Also, Kayo sitting on a fire hydrant is adorable.
