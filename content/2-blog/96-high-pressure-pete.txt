*High Pressure Pete* is a lesser known creation by George Swanson, who signed his work and is credited as "Swan." Swanson is better known for his earlier strip *Salesman Sam*. How Pete came about is very similar to how Gene Ahern's *Room and Board* did (see [an earlier post](http://blog.arkholt.com/our-boarding-house-01) for more info on that strip): King Features Syndicate wanted Swanson to do *Salesman Sam* for them, though they couldn't use that title or the characters. Therefore, Charles Small continued to do *Salesman Sam* at the Newspaper Enterprise Association, and Swanson moved to King Features and created *High Pressure Pete*, which had the same characters with different names and the same overall theme. It lasted for about 10 years, and ended around the same time *Salesman Sam* did.

In this strip, Pete is the one on the far left in the first panel, and the fuming one on the far right is his boss, Hank Hookem. I imagine Hank is upset because the gift implies that he has no hair. It seems well-meaning, though, as it's probably meant to help him grow some of it back. As someone who has lost quite a bit of hair myself, I would be very appreciative of such a gift, or at least the thought behind it.
