Here's a Salesman Sam left over from last year, with bonus Roughin' Reddy topper. Here we have two different ideas about New Year's Resolutions. Reddy's decided to make one that is vague and possibly achievable, but that if he fails to keep he can blame someone else for. Sam and Mr. Guzzlem, on the other hand, prefer to keep theirs by interpreting the meaning of the resolution in a way it wasn't intended. I'm not sure which one would be more effective. Reddy's method would probably take less work, but Sam's method would give him more of an opportunity to gloat. Neither of them seem very safe, though. I imagine they'll both end up with some kind of physical injury.
