I've already gushed about Payne's artwork enough, so for this one I'll just say that I love this joke, or joke within a joke. Willyum "makes a crack" about asking for a goldfish from Santa, which you imagine might actually be true given his age, but the actual punchline is that it's a scheme to get Christmas money. Why people pay him for that I can't imagine. Still, it gets a nickel out of Pop, so that's a success. I just wonder what he's going to buy with it.
