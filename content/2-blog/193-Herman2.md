Here's Herman again, and he's finally gotten up the courage to actually ski down the slope. His unfortunate accident here may have been what he was afraid of in the strip I posted yesterday. It also makes me wonder if the Valley Lodge tailor shop put certain obstacles on the slope on purpose to drive business to them.
