That rebus is clever, but it doesn't entirely work for me. What he says is a "bush" looks more like a tree, and a Christmas tree at that. It does break the fourth wall in quite a big way, as well. I mean, pointing to the artist's signature? I didn't know a comic strip character was allowed to do that. Unless, of course, she's *not* pointing to his signature, but instead has written "Ernie Bushmiller" on the ground for us.

I'm probably thinking a little too hard about this.
