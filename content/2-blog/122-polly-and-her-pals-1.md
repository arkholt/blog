Here we have one of my favorite unknown cartoonists, Cliff Sterrett, with *Polly and Her Pals*, complete with a topper, which I actually like more than the strip itself. Unfortunately, Polly only appears in one panel, but we do get the ridiculously legged cat in quite a few of them. Sterret's cartoons are more fun to look at than to read, in my opinion, but the gag in this one isn't too horrible.
