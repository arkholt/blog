Going back to the idea of even the greatest cartoonists reusing their old jokes, here we see a Pogo strip similar to the one I posted yesterday. It has been reworked a bit, and some dialogue has been added (I like the addition of "See if I remember how it goes"), but in essence it's the same strip. Still, it's a good one.
