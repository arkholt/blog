It's Papa Who Pays was the topper to Toots and Casper, both of which were created by Jimmy Murphy. This is a fair representation of the strip as a whole, with Papa always coming out with nothing in the end after his family takes advantage of him somehow. I don't quite understand how the situation in this particular strip happens, though. Why would someone give someone a gift, then take the gift back from them to give to someone else? It's re-gifting of an entirely different sort. I guess it was more common in the 20's.
