I shared a strip from *[The Nebbs](http://blog.arkholt.com/the-nebbs-1)* earlier, which was a rip-off of *The Gumps*, so here we have the genuine article. The thing that's always interested me about the strip is that Andy Gump is a ridiculous looking character with no chin, in a world that's interestingly devoid of other cartoonish characters. It all looks rather serious and realistic, except for Andy himself.

Andy is a bit dim-witted and cowardly at times, but here we see that he still has quite a giving heart, and has passed it on to the next generation. It does leave me with one question, though: Did they actually visit those two little cripples Mrs. Gump told them about?
