*Sir Bagby*, by Bill and Rick Hackney, was a fairly obscure comic strip that ran from 1957-1966. That's a fairly respectable period of time, though it only ran in about 20 newspapers across the country. Still, I really enjoy the artwork, and the gags are at least as good as anything you see in the newspaper these days. It's a shame it didn't get more exposure. I wonder if Brant Parker and Johnny Hart were aware of it when they created *The Wizard of Id*, a similarly themed comic strip, in 1964.
