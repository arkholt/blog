Virgil Partch, creator of Big George, was more well-known for his single panel magazine cartoons, but due to the prodding of his friend Hank Ketcham, creator of Dennis the Menace, he eventually made it into the newspaper. He had to tone down his humor a bit from his magazine work, as his gags weren't always family friendly material. Still, he clearly didn't have trouble coming up with enough gags for the papers to run, because the strip ran for 30 years. In fact, Partch was able to work extremely far in advance of his deadlines, so he actually had years' worth of strips backlogged. This came in handy for the syndicate after his death in 1984, as they had enough material to continue printing new strips for another 6 years!

Here we see Big George himself, the bumbling husband and father wearing the Christmas stocking. With how early some kids get up on Christmas morning, and with how stressful the holiday season can be, I can completely understand somehow getting a sock on your foot that was never meant to be there. I do wonder, though, if only the candy cane was in there or if there were other treats and stocking stuffers that he's been stepping on this whole time. I hope there was no LEGO.
