I also highly appreciate Walt Kelly's Pogo. As someone who prefers to draw cartoon animals to cartoon people, I think Pogo is the best example of a large, diverse cast of fun animal characters. While there are some well-known politically satirical episodes in Pogo, during Christmastime Kelly tended to stay light and silly. He often would come up with new versions of Christmas carols, such as the one featured in the first strip here, "Deck Us All With Boston Charlie, Walla Walla Wash and Kalamazoo."

In these three strips, we see Porky Pine, a sad porcupine orphan, being shown the true spirit of Christmas by being included in the festivities even though he thought he wasn't. Warms my heart.
