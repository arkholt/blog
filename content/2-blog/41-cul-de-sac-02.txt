Mr. Danders, the guinea pig, is an odd character. He seems to have the ability to speak, and so do certain other animals and things in the Cul de Sac world. I'm not sure if this is merely in the mind of the children or if it's actually occurring, and it's never really explained. I guess it depends on what you want to believe.

Also, I love Richard Thompson's crosshatching. I mean, just look at it!
