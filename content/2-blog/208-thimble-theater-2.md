Thimble Theater, and the character of Popeye, were created by E.C. Segar, but several artists and writers have continued the strip long after Segar's death. Here we have a strip by Tom Sims and Bob Zaboly, featuring the famous glutton J. Wellington Wimpy. Wimpy was known by those who read the strip and those who watched the cartoons as a man with a bit of a black hole for a stomach, but 5 entire turkeys is even more than I imagined he could handle. The strip seems to indicate that he had appointments to eat all of those dinners, so it's not necessarily his fault entirely. I imagine each of them were just kind enough to invite him over to eat a holiday meal, and Wimpy graciously accepted each invitation. How could he refuse? Obviously there were consequences, but I don't imagine turkey sickness lasts more than a day or two.

A fun side note: While the popular chicken restaurant chain Popeye's was not named after the comic strip sailor man but was instead named after the police detective Jimmy "Popeye" Doyle from The French Connection, the popular diner restaurant chain Wimpy _was_ actually named after J. Wellington Wimpy, at least according to the official company website.
