This strip doesn't mention Christmas at all, which is odd, given how many Arthurian legends take place on Christmas. Still, it seems like it ought to be Christmas, what with it being winter, and family coming together and all, and the fact that it was published on December 25. I've always liked Prince Valiant, and though this artwork isn't as good as the original artist Hal Foster's, John Cullen Murphy still does a fine job.

Merry Christmas, everybody!
