I've covered The Gumps previously at Christmas ([here](http://blog.arkholt.com/the-gumps-1) and [here]http://blog.arkholt.com/the-gumps-2)), and showed Andy Gump's incredible generosity at this time of here. This one, however, goes as far as to quantify just how generous he is. I like the fact that when he discovers he has more money than he thought he did, he realizes he has more to give away.

If only there were more people like Andy in the world.
