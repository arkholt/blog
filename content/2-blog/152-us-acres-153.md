Wade the duck has always confused me. He always wears that floaty thing, because I guess he doesn't swim that well, but it has a miniaturized version of his head on it. That's weird in itself, but it also always has a similar facial expression to his, and if he happens to be wearing anything, the mini-duck is wearing it, too. Did Orson get Wade a scarf, and somehow a tiny scarf appeared on the duck head, too? Or did Orson get scarves for both Wade and the mini-duck? It's confusing.
