Richard Thompson, and Cul de Sac, have been a major inspiration for me. I love the writing and the characters, but I'm fascinated by the art. Those lines... I love those lines. It's so *messy,* but everything is where it should be, and it just looks *right.* Same with the lettering, which is unlike anything in comic strips. And look at those panel borders! I love Richard Thompson's signature, too. It's what you would expect from someone who draws this way.

I started out the month by posting a number of strips by Winsor McCay, who drew things very precisely, with very straight lines and strict perspectives. While I enjoy looking at that, the messiness of Thompson's drawing just draws me to it. I just enjoy the fact that it can look that way and still look *right.* There's nothing I would change about it. It doesn't need cleaning up. It's beautiful the way it is.
