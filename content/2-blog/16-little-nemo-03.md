It's interesting to note that McCay's Santa Claus is not colored consistently. He wears red, blue, and green in different strips. These days, we wouldn't dream of having Santa wear anything but red and white, but it wasn't always so. McCay was probably just following the trend. His hat, and the hats of his elves, are also far pointier, and not as floppy.

I like the fact that Nemo glances at the Ladies' room and the lady tells him to keep moving.

Also... what is that outfit Nemo is wearing...??
