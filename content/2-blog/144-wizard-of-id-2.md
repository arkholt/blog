Here we have Bung, the drunken jester, leaving a present for Blanch, the Wizard's wife. I'd guess that the snowball was meant to be used on her husband, but the king is a good enough target. I also noticed that his subjects must all believe his Christmas wishes to be insincere, as none of them wish him a merry Christmas back. Either that, or it's some kind of royal rule not to speak back to the king (though throwing a giant snowball at him is perfectly legal).
