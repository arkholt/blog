I love this one. The absurdity of Ignatz hanging two stockings because he has two feet is already funny enough for me, but the escalation to four stockings due to having four feet is even better. It's kind of odd as far as cartoon animals go, though. We say four legged animals have four feet because they stand on all four of them, but cartoon animals only stand on two. So, do cartoon animals also have four feet? I'm actually inclined to say they don't.

So sorry, Ignatz, only two stockings for you this year.
