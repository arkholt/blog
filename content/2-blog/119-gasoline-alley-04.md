I posted a couple Gasoline Alley Christmas strips a couple years ago, but I can never get enough of them. Plus, the strip is nearing its 100th birthday, and amazingly is still running in newspapers, though the current run is a shadow of the strip's former glory.

Here we have a fascinating journey to the North Pole, to meet a Santa Claus who looks quite unlike what most people these days are used to seeing. He employs not only elves to make toys for boys, but also fairies to make toys for girls. Jack Frost apparently lives there as well. It's an interesting strip in many ways, and the art is superb.
