Bobby Make-Believe was created by Frank King, who is better known as the creator of Gasoline Alley. Bobby only lasted from 1915 to 1919, and Gasoline Alley came along in 1918 and is most likely the reason why Bobby's strip was scrapped. Bobby seems like the type of kid that would fit right in with the Gasoline Alley folks, though, and the strip has a similar aesthetic and writing style to what King would write later.

Unlike yesterday's strip, Bobby isn't entirely selfless and says if he ever met Santa that he would ask him for things for himself as well as make sure the kids he doesn't like don't get anything. Still, he has a good heart and cares about his friends who are less fortunate, and would make sure Santa brings them something nice that they would like. I love that he mentions the kid on crutches who can't use toys, and asks Santa to bring him some books instead. It also seems to be implied that he has a bit of a crush on Virginia, given that he asks Santa to bring her all kinds of things. It's all make-believe, obviously, but I love how King is able to show who Bobby really through a simple fantasy.
