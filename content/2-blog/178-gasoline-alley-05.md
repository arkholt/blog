I've posted some Gasoline Alley Christmas strips a couple of times previously, so here's another one, because I can't get enough. I love Frank King's artwork, and I love the bumbling way that Walt does things for Skeezix, because he just wants to make him happy. I also get the feeling that maybe Skeezix knows it wasn't really Santa but is playing along for Walt's benefit. It makes this a very cute strip all in all.
