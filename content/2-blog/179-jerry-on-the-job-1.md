I love *Jerry On the Job*, because it's cute and funny, but also quite bizarre. It stars Jerry, a kid who looks no older than 6 years old, as he does various jobs over the course of the strip's run. He starts out as an office boy at a train station, and later becomes a messenger boy and even later a retail clerk, all while maintaining the same age and stature. I like him for the same reason I like Kayo from *Moon Mullins*: he's a kid who acts like a kid, but can still stand toe to toe with the adults.

Here, he gives you everything you need to celebrate Christmas, including "turk" and "S. Claus," my favorite Christmas abbreviations.
