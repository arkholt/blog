I think the problem with the future is not only that it keeps turning into the present, but that we all act like Calvin here and expect the future to be better and don't participate in *making* it better. I understand that there's only so much a six-year-old and tiger can do. I think we all feel as helpless as them sometimes. I certainly do. Hopefully, though, this year *can* be better, and we can figure out a way to make it so.

Happy New Year, folks.
