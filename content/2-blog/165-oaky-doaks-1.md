Here's a new year's wish from Oaky Doaks and King Cedric. Oaky Doaks was a strip drawn by Ralph Fuller, whose art I quite like, despite the king's insistence that he can't draw (and the poor quality of this scan). Oaky was a medieval knight who was never formally knighted, and who made his armor out of a tin roof. Here we see them relaxing on a rock after most likely losing Oaky's horse, Nellie.

I wonder why the king doesn't get any fan mail, though, being that he is the king. You'd think he could get some kind of royal scribe to write him some fake ones, at least.
