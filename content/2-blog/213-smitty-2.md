I [started last year](http://blog.arkholt.com/smitty-1)'s round of Christmas comic strips with Smitty, and I couldn't resist posting another one this year. Here, Smitty highlights one of the most important aspects of the Christmas spirit: even if you know where the presents are hidden because whoever's hiding them is really bad at it, you should leave them where they are until they're given to you. It's always better to make them think that they're good at hiding things and not spoil the surprise. Then, throughout the rest of the next year, you should subtly help them with their hiding skills so that you won't run into the same problem next Christmas.
