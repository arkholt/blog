Every kid has (or thinks they have) perfected the art of faking being asleep, for various reasons, but especially at Christmas.  I've never been a parent, so I don't know how it is from their perspective. As a kid, though, I was always fairly sure that my parents thought I was asleep and didn't know that I wasn't, though I imagine they probably knew more often than then didn't. I never remember them saying anything about it, though. I guess it didn't really matter then, so maybe I shouldn't have bothered.
