Here's another one from Harry Hershfield (whose name the paper erroneously spells "Herstfield"). This is clearly some kind of dream sequence, where Abie is flying with Santa Claus above the world and doing a crossword puzzle with the land below. It's still a bit odd that a Jewish immigrant would dream of this, but I guess Christmas is such a large part of American culture in December that it's very difficult to avoid it.

Also, I just love the hatching and crosshatching in this strip. It's a thing of beauty.
