I never went to see Santa Claus at the mall when I was a kid. It wasn't because my parents wouldn't take me, or because the lines were too long, but because I didn't really want to. My parents offered to take me, but I always declined. I don't really remember why. I think maybe I was just shy and didn't want to talk to a strange man in a red suit, or maybe it was because I didn't think meeting him in person to tell him what I wanted would really make much difference in what I got. Plus, who wants to wait in that kind of line?
