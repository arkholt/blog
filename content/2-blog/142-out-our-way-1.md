Out Our Way was a long running single panel comic strip, created by J. R. Williams. It was a slice of life, Americana nostalgia strip, kind of like if Norman Rockwell had been a newspaper cartoonist. While it was always meant to bring a smile to your face, sometimes it was because it was a funny joke, but sometimes it was because it brought back good memories. The best part for me, however, is the artwork, which is phenomenal. The line work is amazing, and I love just staring at his hatching and crosshatching. In fact, I think I'd actually hang one of these on my wall.
