Nothing like a good old-fashioned nativity play, complete with beagle sheep. Really, I don't have much else to say about this one. I just thought it was cute. I guess that's the mark of a good comic strip: at times it can be deep, philosophical, and heavily relatable to everyday struggles, but at other times it can, and should, just be cute.
