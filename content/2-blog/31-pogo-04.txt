Walt Kelly was well known for making his own versions of well-known Christmas Carols. "Deck Us All In Boston Charlie" was probably his most popular, and is featured in this strip. Of course, there were other strips which gave us the "Twelve Days of Crispness," which included a parsnip in a pear tree, as well as the lively "Good King Sauerkraut." "Boston Charlie" actually has six verses, which you can read by [clicking here](http://www.straightdope.com/columns/read/458/what-are-the-lyrics-to-walt-kellys-classic-carol-deck-us-all-with-boston-charlie). Learn them and sing them at your Christmas party. I dare you.
