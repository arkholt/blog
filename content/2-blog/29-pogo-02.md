Again we see Porky Pine, the perpetually grumpy, promising to smile for Pogo and Albert. It apparently takes some preparation and thought, as it isn't something Porky does very often. Unfortunately, no one gets to see it, and Walt Kelly only has to draw three panels (I tell you, the darkened room is the best way for cartoonists to save time and effort without looking lazy). While this is the case, I think it does show that while Porky normally is grumpy, he at least is generous enough at Christmastime to try to give us a gift like that.
