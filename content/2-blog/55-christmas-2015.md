Since it's December, I felt the need to take some time and share some comic strips related to Christmas, because I like Christmas and I like comic strips. I also felt the need to share some comic strips that most people may not be familiar with. They were well-known in their time, but it seems that these days the only comic strip that most people know is *Peanuts* (which they often mistakenly call "Charlie Brown"). So, to start off, here's a Christmas comic strip featuring several comic strip characters of yesteryear:

This is a Mutt and Jeff strip from 1913, drawn by Bud Fisher. You can see Mutt standing in the center giving the toast, with Jeff sitting to the left of him. Going counter-clockwise, we have R.F. Outcault's Buster Brown, Winsor McCay's Little Nemo, Nemo's buddy Flip, Frederick Burr Opper's Happy Hooligan, T.E. Powers' Gloom, E. Pluribus Dingbat from George Herriman's *The Dingbat Family*, Tad Dorgan's Silk Hat Harry, Mr. Newlywed and his baby from George McManus' *The Newlyweds*, Pinkey from Jimmy Swinnerton's *Little Jimmy,* T.E. Powers' Joy (who goes with Gloom), Pinky's friend Shrimp, Harry Hershfield's Desperate Desmond (who mentions Hershfield's other character Dauntless Durham), Polly's Pa from Cliff Sterrett's *Polly and Her Pals*, and finally, Jiggs from George McManus' *Bringing Up Father*.

Isn't it great to see all these comic strip characters having a wonderful Christmas celebration together? I'd love to be there, if it were possible. If only *I* was a comic strip character who lived in 1913.
