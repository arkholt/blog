Muggs McGinnis was an attempt by the small Central Press Association syndicate to capitalize on the popularity of King Features syndicate's [Skippy](http://blog.arkholt.com/skippy-1) by creating an extremely similar comic strip. Unfortunately, it didn't do well enough to keep the CPA syndicate afloat, as King Features acquired them, and Muggs McGinnis, in 1930, merely three years after the strip debuted. CPA remained a subsidiary of King Features and retained control of most of their strips. In 1936, however, King took over Muggs McGinnis, renaming it "Muggs and Skeeter." As we can see here, however, not all newspapers printed it with the new name right away, as this paper was still running it under the old name in 1937.

As for this strip, I wonder why it is that Peewee isn't happy that a halo has appeared over his head. I guess he doesn't want grown-ups' expectations of him to be too high. Either that, or it shines too brightly and keeps him awake at night.
