The Christmas comic strip tradition continues, beginning with Mutt and Jeff, originally created by Bud Fisher. Jeff seems to have a different idea of what "out in the woods" means than I do. It seems to be more along the lines of "out in a snowy field near a few buildings." Perhaps they decided that avoiding private property owners would be easier than possibly having to avoid bears.
