Little Jimmy, by Jimmy Swinnerton, was one of the very earliest comic features with recurring characters. The titular character Jimmy was often seen getting into trouble, as well as causing it. Jimmy doesn't appear in this particular strip, however, and all the trouble is caused by Mrs. Perkins' dog Violet. Of course, one could say that the Major has actually caused the trouble himself by kicking Violet in the first place. I'm sure the real Santa is always very kind to animals.
