The logic of children at its finest. It makes sense when you think about it, though I did have to think about it for a bit. I mean, the pole had to get there somehow, right? Of course, we know that the first man to place the pole up there must have been Santa Claus. Pop isn't that far off when he says that it was about ten years before this strip was published that anyone successfully reached it, though it might be closer to fifteen. The tradition of Santa Claus living there probably came about in the 19th century, so I'd say the answer to Jimmy's question is probably around 60 or 70 years.

This strip, unlike the one from yesterday, was actually done by Gene Byrnes, and when you compare the two you can certainly tell the difference. The line work in Byrnes' strips is much more crisp, and the hatching is exquisite. The ghost artists did a great job of capturing the feel of Byrnes' artwork, but it's no substitute for the real thing.
