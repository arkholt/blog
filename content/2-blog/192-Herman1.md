As it's now December again, I'm reviving my blog to bring you another month full of great Christmas and winter-related comic strips!

I decided to ease into the season with a winter-themed Herman comic strip. Herman was a strip created by Clyde Lamb, not to be confused with the other comic strip named Herman by Jim Unger, which is completely unrelated. Here we see Herman doing what I would most definitely do were I ever to find myself at the top of a ski jump: realize that the ski lift is far more entertaining and far less frightening and taking it down (and maybe taking it up and down one more time just for fun).
