I like this particular strip, because it shows who Hank Ketcham's Dennis the Menace really is: not a menace by intention, but just a kid who is inadvertently always causing trouble. After all, he's here having a tea party with a girl, and the only trouble he causes is upsetting Joey over the presents he might not get. I mean, I'm sure Joey believes he's been good, but who knows what his mother thinks about it, and what she's been telling Santa.
