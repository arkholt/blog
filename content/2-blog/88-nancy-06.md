Here's another Nancy, this time about going to see Santa Claus at the mall. I can imagine a kid saying something like that, though, because he can't think of anything due to being excited or nervous to see Santa. As a kid, I was always too scared, even though my parents took me to the mall to see him. My memories consist entirely of looking at the line of people while standing outside the area and telling my mom I didn't want to. I don't even remember ever seeing the guy in the Santa suit from far away. I was a very shy child. I don't think I've changed much. Guys in Santa suits still make me nervous.
