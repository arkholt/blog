Somebody's Stenog was another "working girl" comic strip from the 1910s and 1920s, much like Winnie Winkle. Unlike Winnie Winkle however, who was written as intelligent and competent, the stenog of the title, named Cam O'Flage, was written as a bit more aloof and empty headed. Still, she pulls a clever trick in this strip by taking advantage of her boss's greed as well as his penchant for eavesdropping on his employees' conversations. The only problem there is that she'll have to actually buy him something now.
