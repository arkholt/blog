Bill Holman is best known for "Smokey Stover," the Sunday comic about funny fire fighters, but around the same time that strip started, he also took over a gag panel originally created by Gaar Williams. The panel had run under many different titles, sometimes changing daily, though eventually under Holman it would come to be known as "Nuts and Jolts."

This particular one is named "Christmas Spirit," and has a pretty good solution for those times when you live in a multi-story apartment but you buy a Christmas tree that's much too tall.
