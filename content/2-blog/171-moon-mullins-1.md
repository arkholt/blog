Moon Mullins was a surprisingly long-running strip that began in 1923 and ran all the way to 1991, and went through three different cartoonists. Ferd Johnson worked on the strip for a record 68 years, first as assistant to the original creator Frank Willard, and then as the main writer and artist.

Here we have one from the Willard years, with Kayo, the younger brother of the eponymous Mullins, trying to get a little money out of the grumpy (but comparatively rich) Lord Plushbottom, one of the denizens of the boarding house most of the cast lives in. Lady Plushbottom owns the place, so Kayo is probably obligated to get her something. Kayo is definitely my favorite character of the crew, because I love his character design and personality. Any kid who stands up to grown-ups while wearing a bowler hat is funny in my book.
