This one is just incredibly wholesome, and Annie here has the attitude that I wish far more adults would have. Annie was, of course, an orphan who was adopted into a wealthy family, yet she doesn't take it for granted. She's grateful for what she has, and she remembers that there are others who are still in the position that she used to be in. If only we could all act this way, the world would be in a much better state.
