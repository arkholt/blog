In June of 1911, when it moved from the New York Herald to the New York American, Little Nemo's strip was renamed "In the Land of Wonderful Dreams," but it still had the same basic premise. Doctor Pill here gives Flip a magical chair, which appears to wrap its arms around whoever sits in it and run around. Many of Nemo's dreams seem to involve living furniture. I wonder why.
