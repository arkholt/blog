This is a very early Thimble Theater, nearly 10 years before Popeye would appear. At this time Olive Oyl was in love with Harold Hamgravy, who we see here coming up with a romantic idea that falls flat. After Popeye appeared in 1929, he was so popular that he replaced Hamgravy completely. I'd guess it's because he didn't pull stunts like this.
