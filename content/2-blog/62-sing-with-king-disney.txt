King Features Syndicate distributed a number of comic strips featuring Disney characters, and some characters that first appeared in those strips went on to become very popular in other media. Most notably of these are Huey, Louie, and Dewey, the three nephews of Donald Duck. They originally appeared in a Donald Duck Sunday comic in 1937. Here we find them singing with other Disney characters who all first appeared in animation. It's unfortunate that their uncle Scrooge doesn't appear here, but not only does he hate Christmas, he had only been created two years prior to this booklet being released.
