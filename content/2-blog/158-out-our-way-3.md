Maybe the dog didn't recognize him, but those kids most certainly do. That Santa isn't nearly plump enough to play the part. I can see he dropped the bag, but there's no sign of any discarded pillows or other stuffing to go inside the suit to simulate Santa's belly. That's why they want to know why he didn't go down the chimney. He's so thin, he would probably fit with no trouble.
