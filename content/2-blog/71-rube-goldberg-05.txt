Rounding off our December classic comic strips this year is another Rube Goldberg device for getting rid of a New Year's party guest who refuses to leave. They show up at every party, sometimes invited and sometimes not, and don't seem to realize that the party isn't at their house. Introverts such as myself won't need to worry about this problem, as we don't tend to throw parties in the first place, and if we do get roped into going to one, we usually leave quite early anyway. For those of you who do end up throwing a New Year's party, you will definitely need this contraption at some point, perhaps to dispatch more than one unruly guest.
