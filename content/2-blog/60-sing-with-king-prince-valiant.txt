In 1949, King Features Syndicate released a booklet called "Sing With King at Christmas," which included several Christmas carols and showed various King Features comic strip characters singing them. Today's selection features Prince Valiant, the incredible long-running adventure comic strip created by the great illustrator Hal Foster. Prince Valiant, which started in 1937, still runs in newspapers today. The titular Prince lives in the days of King Arthur and does the kind of things you'd imagine a medieval knight would do, apparently including serenading fair maidens. Of course, this song doesn't quite date back to medieval times, so I imagine that picture actually depicts him singing something else.
