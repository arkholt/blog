They'll Do It Every Time was a single panel strip that ran for 80 years(!) and was created by Jimmy Hatlo. Readers were known to submit ideas for many of the gags, such as this one, which involved the inability to get a usable photo for a holiday card. These days it's not as much of a problem, what with digital cameras and all, but in the days when you had to bring your film somewhere to get developed, and you had to wait to find out how terrible your photos were, it was much more of a frustration. Still, I don't think anyone would really notice if you cut the photos in half and taped the good halves together and tossed the bad ones.
