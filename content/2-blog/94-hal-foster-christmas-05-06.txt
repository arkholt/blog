These are the last two days of Hal Fosters *The Christmas Story* series. It's interesting to note that while this series originally ran only once in 1948, it was also re-released in 1996. The size that newspapers printed comic strips at that time had drastically decreased from how large they were printed in 1948, so I don't imagine it looked nearly as good as it did originally. It would be neat to be able to run another Hal Foster series, however, since Foster had died 14 years earlier.
