Title: The "I" In Comic Strip Lettering

A couple of days ago, I found out something that I can't believe I never knew or noticed before. It came from [a post on the Zukahnaut blog](http://www.blog.zukahnaut.com/2015/08/03/lettering-comics-the-trickiest-letter/), by Ã–tty Justason, where there was a handy image explaining how the capital "I" should be written when lettering comic strips and comic books.

Basically, the normal "I" should be used in most circumstances, and the crossbar version of "I" should only be used in very specific cases, normally if it's a pronoun or someone's name or in an acronym.

Someone I followed on Twitter retweeted this, and I was a bit skeptical, as I had never heard of this rule before. I use the crossbar version of the "I" all the time, and the font I created for my comic strip, which is just based on my normal handwriting, includes only the crossbar version. I replied to him asking if this was a new rule that he'd come up with, or if it was some hard and fast rule that was in wide usage. He said it had been around for at least a century. My response was that comic art has evolved quite a bit in the past century, so it stands to reason that rules from a hundred years ago could be reexamined. I certainly don't see a problem with the crossbar version, and as long as the text is readable and you can get across what you're trying to say, it shouldn't matter. As a cartoonist, I figured I could just ignore the rule as well as anyone who called me on it.

As a comic strip enthusiast, however, it was fascinating to me, and I looked at all the comic strips that I could from all the cartoonists that I could, trying to see if they followed the rule. Nearly every comic strip I looked at did. Many cartoonists just didn't use the crossbar version at all, but those that did only used them in pronouns or names as the rule says you should. There are even some that mainly use lowercase letters, such as Cul de Sac and Bizarro, but even in the rare instances where all capital letters are used in order to add emphasis, they still follow the rule. I even looked at web comics, and everyone seemed to be following the rule there as well. I wondered if *every* cartoonist followed the rule, or if there was somehow a cartoonist that bucked the trend. If so, I had to find it, partially because it was an interesting bit of comic strip history, but mostly to vindicate myself in ignoring the rule. After a wide search of all kinds of comics, I narrowed it to more famous, successful syndicated comic strips. I looked through the various strips on GoComics, and after a while I finally found one.

Dilbert.

Yes, Scott Adams, who draws Dilbert, does not follow the rule. It is the only comic strip that I've been able to find so far that doesn't follow it, besides my own, but that's enough for me. If a comic strip can be as successful as Dilbert has been and not follow the rule, then I feel safe in not following it either.

I still wonder, however, why I never knew this. Not only that, but I wonder how all these other cartoonists *did* know it. Where did they learn it from? I can guess syndicated cartoonists probably learned it from their editors, and some may have learned it in art school, or from other cartoonists they worked with before striking out on their own. But web cartoonists? Where did *they* learn it? It's a mystery to me.

And even though it is kind of silly, I do think it's neat that a century-old rule that began in print comics has continued for this long and into the world of web comics. Even though I won't be following it, it will be hard to forget. There's no way I'll be able to ignore it when reading comics now.
