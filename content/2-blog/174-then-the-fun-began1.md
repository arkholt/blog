There isn't much info about this comic panel online, other than it was started by Walter Berndt, and abandoned and passed off to Fred Faber when Berndt's other strip *Smitty* became more popular. Faber did an admirable job carrying it on for another 5 years, and this is one of his.

I really enjoy this panel, mainly because it relies on what isn't actually shown in the strip for its comedy. It's about the funny consequences of the situation that's presented more than the situation itself. Plus, the artwork is very fun and well-drawn.
