*Dooley's World* was a comic strip that ran from 1972 to 1978, and centered around a young boy named Dooley and his living toys. Every year on Christmas Eve, the strip would have the same joke, with the characters trying to recite the poem "'Twas The Night Before Christmas" only for Max the mouse to be unable to complete it. Had the strip run for a few more years, Max may have finally been able to do it, but unfortunately it didn't last as long as it should have.

*Dooley's World* was created by Roger Bradfield, who spent most of his career as an illustrator, with *Dooley's World* being his only venture into comic strips. He is probably best known for creating the original look of the Keebler Elves, and for doing many illustrations for the front of cereal boxes. His style was minimal but fun, and while a joy to look at it definitely belongs to another time.
