Here's another *High Pressure Pete*, which was published exactly a year after the last one. Here, Officer 6 7/8 (whose civilian name is Joe) tries his best to help out his friends with their Christmas decorating, but is too dimwitted to do it right. It's not a total loss, though. There's nothing stopping them from hanging some things from that, uh, trunk. Plus, they can use the rest for firewood.
