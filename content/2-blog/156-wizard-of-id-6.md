Apparently the Wizard *still* didn't believe in Santa, even after [actually running into him](http://blog.arkholt.com/wizard-of-id-4), so he had to take a look through his trusty telescope to verify it. Turns out that the Evil Spirit was right, and he *should* be putting up a stocking. It's a bit confusing, though, that a wizard, who is a magical being, wouldn't believe in a different magical being who happens to give out presents. I guess I figure they all know each other, because they're all in the same business. Is there just some kind of hierarchy, like with actors, where amateur actors all know each other, but it doesn't mean they know Hollywood actors? Or does the wizard just not get out much, and stay in his tower all the time? Could be either.
