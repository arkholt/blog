Our Boarding House, created by Gene Ahern, centered around the residents of a boarding house belonging to Martha Hoople. Here, we see her husband Major Amos B. Hoople attempting to procure some holiday money with as little work as possible. As someone with no money for the holidays myself, I quite understand his predicament. It's probably a bit too late to try to get a job as a guy in a Santa Claus suit now, though.

Major Hoople was fond of telling outlandish stories to all who would listen, so I hope he listens to the kids who speak to him instead of talking their ears off. Interestingly, just as many people these days refer to the *Peanuts* comic strip as "Charlie Brown," Major Hoople was so popular in his day that most people just called the strip after him. The strip was popular enough that a rival newspaper syndicate paid Ahern to create a comic strip called *Room and Board* with nearly identical characters, but with different names. Oddly, it wasn't as popular as the original.
