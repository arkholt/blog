Krazy Kat needs no introduction, as I've [posted about him](http://blog.arkholt.com/krazy-kat-01) [previously](http://blog.arkholt.com/krazy-kat-02), but I couldn't resist another round of Christmas comics with him.

I realize Krazy's dialect may be a bit difficult to decipher in this one, but in short, he determines that cold snaps always happen in winter, and never in summer. In summer, there are only "hot snaps," which isn't a commonly used phrase but certainly should be.
