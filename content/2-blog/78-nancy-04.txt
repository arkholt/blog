It's actually getting kind of cold down here in Georgia, though not cold enough to do that. I do wonder why Sluggo carries a water pistol around with him in the wintertime, though. Maybe he planned on playing a prank on someone. Maybe Nancy's contrarian attitude saved her from being the recipient of that prank...
