Early on, the strip Winnie Winkle was titled Winnie Winkle, the Breadwinner, because she was a woman working to support her parents. Here we see she and her mother hinting that perhaps her father should assist with this arrangement. I imagine the work he would do would be around the house, because I can't fathom anyone would want to hire a grouchy old man like that.
