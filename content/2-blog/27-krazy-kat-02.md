Again, I love Krazy Kat, mainly because of strips such as this, with the slightly overwrought narration, Krazy's dialect, and the ridiculous idea Krazy has that Ignatz Mouse throwing a brick at him is a sign of affection.

I also enjoy the implication that people who don't believe in Santa are heretical sinners, and therefore are evil, selfish brick-throwers.
