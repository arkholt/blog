One of the interesting things to me about the history of comic strips is the affect that they've had on the English language. I've written about how [a cartoonist's name has made it into the dictionary](http://blog.arkholt.com/comic-strip-history-rube-goldberg-machines/), about how [strange holidays have been created and named in comic strips](http://blog.arkholt.com/comic-strip-history-sadie-hawkins/), but actual words being coined in comic strips is a different thing. It has happened a few times, though.

I stumbled across an interesting fact when reading about the George McManus creation *The Newlyweds* this week. George McManus is better known for his creation *Bringing Up Father*, but this earlier strip is interesting in that its title makes use of a word that had not yet been in common usage.

*The Newlyweds*, also called *The Newlyweds and Their Baby* after they had one, was about a couple who had, as the title suggests, not been married long. Their names were Mr. and Mrs. Newlywed, so the title refers to a proper noun, not the common noun that we know today. It wouldn't have been a common noun, because the strip began in 1904, and at that time the term newlywed was only used as an adjective. In doing a little more research about this, [Dictionary.com](http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/newlywed) dates the first use of the word "newlywed" as a noun to around 1915-1920. [Merriam-Webster](http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/newlywed) dates the first usage a bit earlier, to 1908. The comic strip had been around for at least four years at that time. This makes it very possible that the comic strip was a very early, if not the first, usage of newlywed not only as a noun, but as a plural noun. The [Online Etymology Dictionary](http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=newlywed&allowed_in_frame=0) says as much:

>also newly-wed, 1907, from newly + wed. Probably owes its origin to a then-popular newspaper comic strip, "The Newlyweds and Their Baby," about Mr. and Mrs. Newlywed, by George McManus in the New York "World." As an adjective, newly-wed is attested from 1833.

Very interesting. I know of some other words that were either coined or popularized by comic strips, which I plan to write on later, but it's great to see that it was happening even from their very early days.
