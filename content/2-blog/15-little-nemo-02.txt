I imagine it would be exciting for a little kid to get to drive Santa's sleigh, but at the same time I think it would turn out just as well as it does here. I don't know if every kid would get caught on a windvane, but the sleigh would certainly be lost. Nemo lost the second bag of toys, too! Good thing it was only a dream.
