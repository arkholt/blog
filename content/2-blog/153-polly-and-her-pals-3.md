Here's a strip that I was going to use last year, but didn't end up using. As with most Cliff Sterrett strips, I like looking at the artwork more than reading the joke. It's so fun, interesting, and dynamic, in the main strip and in the topper. Sterrett also teaches us that if you can't draw a cat realistically, just draw it as unrealistically as possible in as many ridiculous positions as you can. It'll work (at least it does here).
