Here's another Will-Yum, having a horrible time the day before Christmas. It reminds me of when I was a kid, trying to figure out what was in my presents by size and weight, and never being able to. One year, there was one under the tree from my dad, which was relatively small but very heavy. I thought about it for days, unable to think of anything that it could be. It turned out there was actually a brick inside (yes, an actual brick), which I never would have guessed. I think it's one of few presents I've received that have rendered me speechless, due to my laughing so hard.

Of course, this was because the actual present wouldn't fit under the tree, as it was a giant framed poster, but I still like telling people that my dad once got me a brick for Christmas.
