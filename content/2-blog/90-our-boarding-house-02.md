Here's Major Hoople again, doing as he does and telling young Alvin a number of obviously untrue stories of his life. I guess it must get pretty boring around the boarding house, because Major Hoople has to invent stories to keep everyone entertained. Either that, or he makes up the stories in order to hide the real truth of his criminal past. Who was Major Hoople, really? What has he done? Who is he running from? We'll never hear it from his own mouth, I guess.
