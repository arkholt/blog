I couldn't find anything indicating whether or not Lee Stanley's The Old Home Town is a rip-off of Out Our Way, but it sure seems like it, given the similarity in style and the fact that it began a year afterwards. Still, while Stanley's art isn't as good as J.R. Williams', and his panel didn't last nearly as long in newspapers, it has its own enjoyable qualities.

I like this particular one a lot, because in a single panel, and a single sentence caption, it establishes so much about the fire chief and the people in town. I love the irony in the caption as well, that sure, he knew exactly what to do, but it may not have been the best idea.

Also, is that a talking horse?
