I haven't updated this blog in quite some time, and when I did it was to whine about Facebook and a single musing about my art. My end of year resolution, as it were, is to do more to share things that I'm passionate about. If there is a single thing that I could pick that I've been passionate about for the longest time, it would be comic strips. Since it's December, and I happen to celebrate Christmas, I figured it would be appropriate to post some Christmas (and New Year) comic strips from cartoonists that I admire and have influenced me, namely Winsor McCay, George Herriman, Walt Kelly, Charles Schulz, Bill Watterson, and Richard Thompson. I hope they are interesting to you, even if you don't happen to celebrate Christmas.
