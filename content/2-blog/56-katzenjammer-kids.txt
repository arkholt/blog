The Katzenjammer Kids is the longest running newspaper comic strip, and still runs in a few newspapers in the United States and several other countries. It started in 1897, and has a very interesting history that I may blog about at a later time. The strip involves two kids, Hanz and Fritz, who are generally mischievous, their mother Mama, and The Captain, whose relationship to Mama and the kids has never really been made clear. All of them speak in some kind of strange pseudo-German dialect, which I find kind of fun, and which I hope isn't offensive to anyone of a German persuasion. I don't find the Asian sailor in The Captain's crew to be quite as fun, but he only gets one line in this strip, so I can ignore it.
