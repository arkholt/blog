This one's a little different, as it's basically just Al Capp giving holiday greetings to a bunch of people, along with a drawing of himself in a Santa Claus outfit. It's probably a bit hard to read, so I've transcribed it for you below:

>"To the vets in the vets' hospitals - and to the fine Red Cross gals who take me out to see you - to Father David Dunnigan - Rabbi Isadore Davidson - Levi Jackson - Harold Russell - Walter Winchell - to the man who marinates the herring at Toots Shor's - Joe Dineed, and his amazing 'Purple Shamrock' - John Mason Brown - John Crosby - Arthur Godfrey- Nancy O. - Secretary of Labor Tobin - Miltons Caniff and Berle - Lee and Connie Falk - Rabbi Philip Bernstein - the Saroyans - Jack Goodman - Tex and Jinx - Leila and Kip Hadley - Chic Young - Rube Goldberg - Bob Ruark - Henry Morgan - Colby College - Faye Emerson - Reg Beauchamp - Helen Hayes and Charlie McArthur - Oona and Charlie Chaplin - Drew Pearson - Billy Reed and his Little Club - Joe Lopez of the Copa - Secretary John Snyder - Verne Clark - Bridgeport Univ. - Thompson and Jacque of the Montreal Standard, one of the top newspaper teams in the world - Gregg Sherwood - E.M. Kahn jr. - Al Hershfeld - Dolly Hass - Sid Caesar - Henny Youngman - Joe E. Lewis - Pat Williams - Alex Raymond - Warde Greene - John Wayne - Glorya and Leopold Stokowski - Louis Sobol, the kindliest of all the kolumnists - Big Joe, and may he grow Bigger - Miss Sarah Lewis of New Haven - Billy Daniels - Bob Trout- Fred Friendly - John Cameron Swayze - Davidson Taylor - Leonard and Sylvia Lyons - James and Pamela Mason - Bob and Mignon McLaughlin - Vaugn Monroe - Bob Allen - Harold Stassen - Jack Lait - 'Twenty One' - Turhan Bey - Larry Winship - Lou Cowan - Arnold Horwitt and Lee Rogow - Charlie and Peg Ross - Ben Hecht - Jimmy Cannon - Bob Hall - John Ringling North - George Jessel - Frank Knight - Virgnia Gilmore - Salvador Dali - Rod MacLeish - Frank Sinatra - Doug Edwards - Louis Gardner - Joey Gold, who can get 'em when no one else can - R. Van Buren - Jack Barry - Barry Gray - T.S. Matthews - Christine Lynn - Eleanor Tatum - Ed and Pegeen Fitzgerald - Jean Sulzberger - Dick Williams - Joe Purtell - Betty Crocker - Betty Betz - Kenny Delmar - Carl Hodge - John McLain - Walter Ross - Harriet Van Horne - Morris Ernst - Elinor Marcus - Mort Millman - Bob Emery, and the Small Fry Club - Nick Kenny - Kenneth Banghart - Pat Coffin - Maxwell Coplan - Gordon Johnson - Ruth Cosgrove - to the Yale Record and the Princeton Tiger (*thanks for your awards*) - Irwin and Marian Shaw - to the **talented** cartooning Fishers, Bud, Dudley, and Jo, that is - Lyman Bryson - the Atlantic Monthly - Fred Garrigus - Charlie Post - Al Foster - Ralph Foster - Roy Larsen - Smitty Davis - Ann and John Groth - and to all you confused by loyal Li'l Abner readers -"

There are some interesting names in there if you take the time to actually read them. The most interesting to me is his mention of "the **talented** cartooning Fishers", meaning Bud Fisher, creator of *Barney Google* and *Snuffy Smith*, Dudley Fisher, creator of *Right Around Home*, and probably Jo Fischer, who spells his name a bit differently, creator of *From 9 to 5*. I'm guessing he's conspicuously omitting Ham Fisher, creator of *Joe Palooka*, with whom Capp had been feuding since the 1930s. That's a story for a different time.
