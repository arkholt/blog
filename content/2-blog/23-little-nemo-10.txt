This is continuing a story where Nemo, Flip, and the Owl are flying various places (including a jail) in their own blimp. This year, Santa apparently has a sleigh-plane, and no reindeer. In Nemo's dreams, Santa has many vehicles, and isn't too good at his job, because he is often losing toys. I would think Nemo would have a higher opinion of him. Thankfully, Nemo and friends help him out, kind of. I mean, wouldn't the toys get all dirty and sooty?
