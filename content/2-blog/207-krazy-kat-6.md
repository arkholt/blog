The escalation in this Christmas sequence is so great. Every time you think Ignatz has been foiled, he is already way ahead, even though the logic of it is still completely absurd. Given how many times Ignatz has been locked in jail, though, I guess it only stands to reason that if hanging up four stockings is against the law Ignatz would be the first to know, and would be the first to do whatever he could to dodge the law. He wouldn't want Officer Pupp giving him any new Christmas lodgings.
