Looking at Winsor McCay's work, and especially Little Nemo, has always impressed me. It's amazing to think that this appeared in a newspaper. Look at where Santa Claus lives! I guess he would need a place that big to house all of the toys for all the children in the world.

The lettering is difficult to read, but you hardly need to. It's nice enough just to look at.
