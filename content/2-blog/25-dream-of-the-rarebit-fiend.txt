Dream of the Rarebit Fiend was another comic strip that Winsor McCay drew prior to Little Nemo. There is a long tradition of cartoonists reusing ideas, and here is an early example of that. You may notice that this one bears a striking resemblance to the [Little Nemo strip from December 13, 1908](http://blog.arkholt.com/little-nemo-in-slumberland-december-13-1908). Of course, instead of Nemo hanging from the roof and freezing, it was originally Santa Claus (or at least John dreaming that he is Santa Claus).
