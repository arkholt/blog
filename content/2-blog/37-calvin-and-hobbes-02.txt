This has always been my favorite Calvin and Hobbes Christmas strip. It evokes all the feelings of Christmas and Christmas Eve, as well as the feeling of friendship, the central element of Calvin and Hobbes. It's also interesting because it's quite different from any other Calvin and Hobbes strip. Instead of a rowdy six-year-old getting into trouble or philosophizing, it's simply a calm scene described in a poem.
