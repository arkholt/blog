Harry Hershfield, creator of Abie the Agent, was a Jewish American, and the comic strips he created featured Jewish people, often immigrants, and how they assimilated, and didn't, into American culture. It's very interesting, then, that Hershfield drew at least one Christmas comic strip a year. In searching for Christmas strips, I really didn't expect to find any Abie the Agent ones, but they were definitely there.

Also, Hannukah starts on December 22 this year, in case you wondered.
