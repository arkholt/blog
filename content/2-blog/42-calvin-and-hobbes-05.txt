While we're right in the middle of this decade, I still agree with Calvin here. Sure, we have some amazing technologies, but not nearly as much as we were promised. Calvin was expecting it back in 89, and it's almost 2015 and we *still* don't have any of that. I mean, at this rate there's no way that we'll have hover boards or power shoe laces by next November.

Anyway, please just sit and admire that first panel for a bit. A simple yet beautiful landscape. I sure hope those don't go away in the future.
