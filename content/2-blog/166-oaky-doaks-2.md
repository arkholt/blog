This strip apparently comes right in the middle of some kind of storyline involving the Earl of Juniper, but no storyline could keep Oaky Doaks from wishing everyone a happy new year. He is quite incorrect about nothing happening in 1936, though. The year saw the death of Grace Drayton, the cartoonist behind the adorable The Pussycat Princess, the end of George Swanson's venerable Salesman Sam strip and E.C. Segars O.G. Wotasnozzle, and the first appearance of the great comic strip superhero The Phantom.

Oaky's mind might just be mixed up, though, given that somehow he lives simultaneously in medieval times *and* in the 1930s. It can mess with your concept of time, for sure.
