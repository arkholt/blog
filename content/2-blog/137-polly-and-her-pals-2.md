Here's another Polly and Her Pals, with wonderful art by Cliff Sterrett. Carrie learns a valuable lesson here about the true meaning of Christmas and about giving and sharing, or almost does. Of course, Angel doesn't seem too happy with either her *or* Paw giving her cookies to the birds. To be honest, I think the birds would be happier with seeds than with cookies. Either way, the lesson is *not* that it's okay to take cookies from children at Christmas, though I don't think it's wrong to ask them if they'd share one with you.
