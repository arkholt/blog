Toppers are notorious for only being a footnote related to the comic strip that they sit atop. That's no exception here. *Little Brother* ran as a topper to H.J. Tuthill's *The Bungle Family,* and that's the extent of the information available on it on the internet. I include it here because I don't find *The Bungle Family* to be that interesting, but I really like this joke.
