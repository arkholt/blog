Edwina Dumm, the cartoonist behind "Capp Stubbs and Tippie" (abbreviated here in the Dayton Herald as simply Cap Stubbs) was the first full-time female editorial cartoonist, and one of few women in the early days of comics to have a syndicated feature. It ran for an impressive 48 years, produced only ever by Dumm herself.

The thing that is most striking to me is the quality of the lettering. Many early comic strips can be difficult to read because of some very messy lettering, but Dumm's letters are very clear and well-formed. The line work is wonderful as well, and a joy to look at. While the dialogue in many Cap Stubbs strips can be a bit dull, it's always, as we see here, very genuine and true to life.
